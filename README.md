Hi! I'm currently a student in the Master's of Environmental Data Science at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UCSB. I'm learning data science skills to investigate and understand environmental data.

I graduated from UC Davis with a Bachelors degree in Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation Biology and since then have worked as a river rafting guide on the Arkansas River and as a field technician collecting data for community ecology research projects.
