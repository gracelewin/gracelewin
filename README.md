Hi! I am passionate about communicating data clearly and effectively for a variety of audiences. 

I hold a master's in Ecology, Evolution, and Ecology, where I researched the connectivity between inland and marine environments through the diets of large terrestrial animals, like coyotes. I also hold a master's in Environmental Data Science where I learned how to process, manage, and visualize many kinds of data.
